# WELCOME TO MY VALIDATOR APP - SPRINGBOOT
Dev: Alex Lopez

## Goal
The purpose of this small application is to validate the input of data that will be saved in another service in this case in my backend application (Simple api-rest).

The idea is that if you want to save data in the back, you must first go through this service and if everything is correct, send the request to the backend.
## IMPORTANT
* To make requests to this service you must have installed some program specialized in REST queries.
  * Personally I use the POSTMAN application.

* It is also necessary to have the following software installed: 
  * Java JDK-17 / OpenJDK 17 (both version support)
  * IntelliJ IDEA Community
