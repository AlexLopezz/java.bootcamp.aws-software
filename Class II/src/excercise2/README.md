# Welcome to my Excercise 2 - Factorial!
* It consists of a method that receives an integer and returns the factorial of the integer (can we do it also with generic types?)

# How to run it?
### Must be directed the Java class that contains a main method inside it.
* Sample:
  * In this address: src/excercise2/Factorial

  * We have a main code block:
  ```
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    IProgramable program = new TheProgram();
    program.run();
    }
  ```
  * Press Ctrl + Shift + F10 and it will run.
