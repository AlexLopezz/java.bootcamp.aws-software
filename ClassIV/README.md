# Welcome to my ClassII Project!
**This project consists of performing basic Java tasks, which allow us to practice coding and improve our programming logic. They are sent by Professor Andres Alberto Ramos, who himself is teaching us in a Bootcamp.**

# Techonologies used: 
  * JDK / OpenJDK (prefered 17)
  * IntelliJ Community Edition

# Each package has a README.md file that explains how to run it. If you want to run a specific one, you must follow the steps in that file. It is necessary to have the technologies used for it to work correctly.
